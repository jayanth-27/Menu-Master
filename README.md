#### LARAVEL APPLICATION #####

### Directory Structure

In a Laravel project, the directory structure is organized to follow Laravel's conventions and best practices for web application development. Understanding the purpose of key directories will help you navigate and manage your project effectively:

- **app**: The `app` directory is the heart of your application. It contains the application's core logic, including models, controllers, middleware, and service providers.

  - `Http`: This directory is where most of your application logic resides. It contains controllers, middleware, and requests. The `Controllers` folder holds your application's HTTP controllers, which handle incoming HTTP requests and manage responses.
  - `Providers`: Service providers define various services, such as database connections and routing, for your application.
  - `Console`: This directory contains Artisan commands that allow you to interact with your application via the command line.
  - `Events` and `Listeners`: These directories are used for defining events and event listeners, which enable you to decouple parts of your application and respond to events.
  - `Exceptions`: Handle exceptions and customize error pages in this directory.

- **bootstrap**: The `bootstrap` directory contains the application's bootstrapping and configuration files. It initializes the Laravel framework and prepares it for handling requests.

- **config**: Configuration files for your application are stored here. You can customize settings for various services, databases, and packages.

- **database**: The `database` directory is used for database-related tasks, such as migrations and seeders.

  - `migrations`: Database migrations define the structure of your database tables and allow for version control of the database schema.
  - `seeds`: Seeder classes populate your database with initial data for testing and development.

- **public**: The `public` directory is the web server's document root, and it contains publicly accessible assets like CSS, JavaScript, and image files.

- **resources**: The `resources` directory stores non-PHP assets, such as Blade templates, JavaScript, and CSS. It is further organized into subdirectories:

  - `views`: Blade templates for your application's views are stored here.
  - `lang`: Language localization files can be placed in this directory.
  - `js` and `css`: JavaScript and CSS files are located here and can be used to style your application.

- **routes**: The `routes` directory contains all of the route definitions for your application, specifying which HTTP requests are directed to specific controller methods.

- **storage**: Laravel uses the `storage` directory for storing various temporary and cache files. It's divided into:

  - `app`: Application-specific files can be stored here.
  - `framework`: Cached views and files generated by the framework are stored here.
  - `logs`: Application logs can be found in this directory.
  - `framework`: Caches, compiled views, and cached configuration files are placed in this directory.

- **tests**: If you write tests for your application, this directory is where your test files and test cases are located. It's a crucial part of maintaining code quality.

- **vendor**: The `vendor` directory contains Composer dependencies and packages used in your application.

- **.env**: The `.env` file at the project root is used to store environment-specific configuration. Database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information should be defined here.

- **.env.example**: This is a template of the `.env` file, providing a reference for environment variables.

- **composer.json and composer.lock**: These files are part of Composer and specify your application's dependencies and versions.

- **package.json and webpack.mix.js**: If you're using JavaScript and CSS compilation, these files are used to manage your front-end assets.


###### INSTALLATION Instructions AND SETUP  ###

###### Prerequisites
You will need the following tools:

Composer
Laravel
Node.js and npm

###### SETUP 
Follow these steps to set up and run the Laravel project from the zipped archive:

1. **Download and Extract the Project**:
   - Download the zipped Laravel project archive from your source.
   - Extract the contents of the archive to a directory on your local machine *** Extract to \restaurant.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Change your current working directory to restaurant . You can use the `cd` command to navigate to the project directory.

   
            cd path/to/restaurant
   

   Replace `path/to/restaurant` with the actual path to your the restaurant folder.

3. **Install Composer Dependencies**:
   - Laravel uses Composer to manage its PHP dependencies. If you don't have Composer installed, you can download it from [https://getcomposer.org/]
   - Install the project's PHP dependencies by running:

   
        composer install



4. **Database Setup**:
   - Create an empty database for your project using your preferred database management tool (e.g., phpMyAdmin or MySQL command-line) AND name it restaurant.
   - Update the `.env` file with your database connection details:

   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=restaurant
   DB_USERNAME=root
   DB_PASSWORD=
   ```


5. **Run Database Migrations**:
   - Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables in your database. Use the following command:

  
         php artisan migrate
  

   This will set up the database schema for this project.

6. **Serve the Application**:
   - You can use Laravel's built-in development server to run your application. Start the server with the following command:

   
        php artisan serve

   - Your Laravel application will be accessible at [http://localhost:8000].

7. **Access the Application**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000] to access your Laravel application.

Your Laravel project is now set up and running.
